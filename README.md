AWS limits the number of images per ECR repository to 1000. This is not a
problem for low-activity projects, but if you have a full-fledged continuous
delivery pipeline in place that pushes images to a repository at every new
commit, sooner or later this limit will require you to periodically remove old
images in order to create room for new ones.

This controller handles this task of automatically keeping the number of images
in a ECR repository under some specified threshold.

## How it Works

First, the controller will query the Kubernetes API server to get the list of
currently running pods from the specified namespaces in order to see which ECR
images are currently in use.

Then, it will load the contents of the specified ECR repositories, sort those
images by push date, and remove from this list the images currently in use.
This step is very important as it ensures images in use _are not accidentally
deleted_. Also, this controller will not touch images tagged with the `latest`
tag.

Finally, it will remove the oldest images from this list.

### AWS Credentials

For the controller to work, it must have access to AWS credentials in
`~/.aws/credentials`, or via `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
environment variables.

The following IAM policy describes which actions the user must be able to
perform in order for the controller to work:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ecr:BatchDeleteImage",
                "ecr:DescribeRepositories",
                "ecr:DescribeImages"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:ecr:us-east-1:<id>:*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

Make sure to set the `Resources` correctly for all ECR repos you intend to
clean up with this controller.

```

## Build Locally

Assuming you have your Go environment already configured:

    1. Clone this repository in `$GOPATH/src/github.com/danielfm/kube-ecr-cleanup-controller`

    2. Run `glide i --strip-vendor` and then `make` to build the binary (or `make image` to build the docker image)

    3. Then, just re-tag the image to `<your-name>/kube-ecr-cleanup-controller:<tag>` and push to your own registry, if you feel like it


Or, you can use a pre-built image hosted in Docker Hub:
